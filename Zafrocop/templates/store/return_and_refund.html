    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Return, Refund & Exchange Policy</h2>
    <p>At <strong>BATHELICIOUS</strong>, we handcraft every product with care and love. Since our range is made with natural ingredients, we follow a transparent policy to ensure both fairness and customer satisfaction.</p>

    <h5>Order Modifications & Cancellations</h5>
    <p>Once an order is placed, it cannot be modified. Customers may cancel their order only before dispatch from our warehouse. After dispatch, cancellations are possible only in rare cases and subject to confirmation from our courier partner. If the shipment is returned to us, the order value will be refunded as store credit after deducting applicable reverse shipping charges. Store credit is issued within 15 business days and can be redeemed on future purchases but cannot be combined with flash sales, BOGO offers, or coupon codes.</p>

    <h5>Returns & Exchanges</h5>
    <p>Products once sold are not eligible for return or exchange under normal circumstances. However, exceptions are made in situations such as damage during transit, delivery of the wrong product, or shipment lost in transit. In such cases, we will arrange a replacement at the earliest possible time.</p>

    <h5>Handmade & Natural Variations</h5>
    <p>As our products are handmade with natural ingredients, slight variations in fragrance, texture, or color may occur. Climatic conditions such as extreme heat or cold can also cause products to either solidify or liquefy. These changes are natural and do not impact product quality. Customers are requested to allow reasonable time for production or delivery delays that may arise during seasonal or environmental challenges.</p>

    <h5>Verification & Unboxing</h5>
    <p>To process any complaint regarding damage, shortage, or defects, a clear <strong>unboxing video</strong> is mandatory. This video must capture the entire process from opening the sealed package to checking the contents. The video should be unedited and submitted to <a href="mailto:support@bathelicious.in">support@bathelicious.in</a> within 48 hours of delivery. Without this evidence, return or exchange requests cannot be processed.</p>

    <h5>Shipment Concerns</h5>
    <p>Any visible damage to packaging or products should be reported immediately with photos or video proof. All orders are packed under strict quality checks and camera supervision at our warehouse. If internal checks confirm the shipment was complete and intact, Bathelicious will not be liable for missing products.</p>

    <h5>Order Updates</h5>
    <p>Customers receive regular updates about order status, shipping, and delivery via Email, WhatsApp, or SMS. Please ensure your communication settings allow these notifications. Bathelicious is not responsible for missed updates due to filters or settings at the customer’s end.</p>

    <h5>Packaging & Presentation</h5>
    <p>While we make every effort to display our products accurately, slight color variations may occur due to lighting, climate, or screen differences. Packaging may also be upgraded from time to time to improve quality. Customers may occasionally receive updated packaging before the website is refreshed.</p>

    <h5>Allergies & Skin Safety</h5>
    <p>Although rare, allergic reactions to natural ingredients may occur. We strongly recommend a patch test on a small area of skin for 24 hours before regular use. If irritation develops, discontinue use immediately. Information on our website is for awareness only and does not replace medical advice.</p>

    <h5>Our Ethical Promise</h5>
    <p>None of our products are tested on animals. Some are vegan — please refer to the ingredient list for details.</p>

    <h5>Customer Support</h5>
    <p>All product or order-related queries should be raised only through our official channels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email: <a href="mailto:support@bathelicious.in">support@bathelicious.in</a></li>
      <li>Phone: +91-9884610544</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Queries on social media (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) may not be attended promptly as these platforms are managed by a separate team.</p>

    <h5>Response Time</h5>
    <p>We aim to respond to all customer queries within five business days. Delays may occur during weekends, festivals, courier strikes, or when external dependencies such as payment gateways or courier companies are involved. Customers will be informed in case of such delays.</p>

    <h5>Privacy & Data Protection</h5>
    <p>Your personal information is safe with us. Sensitive data entered online is encrypted and transmitted using secure SSL technology. We never share customer information without consent.</p>

    <h5>Legal Jurisdiction</h5>
    <p>All disputes, if any, shall be subject to <strong>Tamil Nadu jurisdiction</strong>.</p>
